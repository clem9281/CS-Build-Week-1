"""
What is @csrf_exempt?

Csrf exempt is a feature of django which allows bypassing of csrf verification by django.
By default, django check for csrf token with each POST request, it verifies csrf token before rendering the view. 
Its a very good security practice to verify csrf of post requests as we know django canâ€™t be compromised in case of security.
